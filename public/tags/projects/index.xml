      <description>Glance About a year ago I was tasked with upgrading our Virtual Machine tooling from CentOS 6 to Centos 7. We use KVM and QEMU for our developer VMs and had a very lightweight installation of OpenStack Glance for serving our base images used during creation and bootstrap. In true CentOS fashion, the version of glance that shipped with it was very outdated: 2012.1.1.
Not surprisingly, the version that came with CentOS 7 was much newer but still hopelessly out of date: 2015.</description>
