      <description>If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with Deployinator, it&amp;rsquo;s a tool we wrote to deploy code to Etsy.com. We deploy code about 40 times per day. This allows us to push smaller changes we are confident about and experiment at a fast rate. Deployinator does a lot of heavy lifting for us. This includes updating source repositories on build machines, minifying/building javascript and css dependencies, kicking off automated tests and updating our staging environment before launching live.</description>

      <description>Presenting Virtual Madness! This is part 2 of our LXC blog post. If you missed the first half you can read it here.
We already have much tooling around making it easy to create a virtual machine for each developer, so it made sense to build our LXC virtualization tools into the same interface.
 As shown above, our main page gives a quick look into all the LXC Containers that are running and the Jenkins instances to which they are attached.</description>

      <description>Continuous Integration at Etsy As Etsy continues to grow and hire more developers, we have faced the continuous integration scaling challenge of how to execute multiple concurrent test suites without slowing the pace of our deploy queue. With a deployment rate of up to 65 deploys / day and a total of 30 test suites (unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, smokers&amp;hellip;) that run for every deploy, this means running the test suites 1950 times a day.</description>
